  <h1>Projects</h1>
  <p class="lead">A variety of projects completed over four years at university, showcasing both frontend and backend technical skills.</p>

  <p>As most of these projects were completed on university servers, they are no longer able to be deployed. I have provided brief descriptions here, and further details along with images and walkthroughs
    of the projects can be found on my GitHub.

            <p class="card-text">Over the course of 8 months our team brought this software from a client concept to a finished, functional product. 
                Blur is an open-source platform for easy and secure video-sharing. The purpose of our software is to allow admins (such as doctors, managers, professors, etc.) 
                to request and receive videos from users. From this we can enable asynchronized communication which allows for more efficient communication, enhancing the experience for both the user and admin. 
                The intention of our software is to provide an easy to use, secure solution to asynchronous video sharing. Blur was created using React and a large variety of AWS services including: Cognito, Rekognition, Amplify, Lambda, Appsync. 
                While the website is no longer online due to the AWS hosting being connected to university accounts, a walkthrough of the product can be seen here: <a href = 'https://youtu.be/yZVzmpdfHDQ' target = "_blank">Video walkthrough</a>

                user account page, account creation (login/logout). Administrator features included: inventory display by warehouse, add/update/delete products, order and sales display. This project was dockerized and required our team to create the database and website design.

          <p class="card-text"> Brew Review is an app where users can discover and review new breweries and beer while keeping track of their favourite (and not so favourite) places to go.
            The user is able to add, edit, view, and delete reviews for breweries and beers. They can add and view the reviews through the brewery page, and delete and edit reviews through their user profile. They are also able to search the breweries and view their menu through the app.
            Finally, they are able to see all of their reviews (of beers and breweries) centralized in their user profile.
          </p>
          <p>This is a front-end project, and therefore there is no functional backend. The intention of the project was to build a protoype, building from a paper prototype to a final high-fidelity prototype, incorporating
            user feedback from heuristic evaluations.
